John was planning a trip to visit his friends around the world. First, he called his friend Alice in
New York at (212) 555-6789 to check on her availability. "Hey Alice, I'll be in town next week. What's
your schedule like?" he asked.

Next, he contacted his colleague in London, Sarah, using her number +44 20 7946 0958. "Sarah, let's
catch up over coffee when I'm in London," John suggested.

He then dialed his cousin's number in Sydney, +61 4 1234 5678, to make plans for his stay in Australia.
"Mate, can't wait to see you. Let's hit the beach together!" he said.

John also needed to confirm his hotel reservation in Paris, so he called the hotel at +33 1 23 45 67 89.
"Bonjour! I wanted to confirm my booking for next month," he inquired.

Lastly, John checked in with his parents back home, using their landline number, 555-123-4567. "Mom, Dad,
I'll be back by the end of the month. See you soon!" he promised.
